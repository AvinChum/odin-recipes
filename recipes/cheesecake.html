    <h1>Cheesecake</h1>
    <h2>Discription</h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>
        Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. 
        The main, and thickest, layer consists of a mixture of a soft, fresh cheese 
        (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. If 
        there is a bottom layer, it most often consists of a crust or base made from 
        crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or 
        sometimes sponge cake.[1] Cheesecake may be baked or unbaked (and is usually refrigerated).
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Graham Cracker Crumbs:</strong>
            Honeymaid is my favorite, but any brand is fine. You can grind your own or buy them as crumbs.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Granulated Sugar:</strong>
            to sweeten the crust and the filling.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Melted Butter:</strong>
            to hold the graham cracker crust together.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Cream Cheese:</strong>
            I like using the Philadelphia brand; I think it’s slightly tangier than other off-
            brands out there. Make sure you are using room temperature, soft cream cheese.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Sour Cream:</strong>
            adds an extra tang. This also needs to be at room temperature.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Vanilla Extract:</strong>
            for flavor since this is a classic cheesecake.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Eggs:</strong>
            needed for structure. Absolutely have these at room temperature and beat together before adding in.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <strong>Step 1: Make the Graham Cracker Crust</strong>
        Stir graham cracker crumbs, sugar and melted butter
        <br> 
        together and press into a 9-inch springform pan. Bake for 
        <br> 
        7 minutes in a 350-degree oven. Set aside to cool.
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <strong>Step 2: Make the Cheesecake Filling</strong>
        Stir very soft cream cheese together with the granulated
        <br>  
        sugar. Stir in the vanilla and sour cream. Scrape the sides
        <br>  
        really really well and stir again to ensure there are no lumps.
        <br>
        <br>
        Whisk eggs together in a separate bowl and slowly add 
        <br> 
        to the cheesecake filling with the mixer on. Once eggs
        <br>  
        are incorporated turn mixer off. Scrape the sides really well to
        <br>  
        ensure a very smooth batter. If there are lumps, stir them in by hand.
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <strong>Step 3: Remove Air Bubbles</strong>
        Tap bowl on the counter for 30-45 seconds to remove air
        <br>  
        bubbles. Air bubbles can contribute to why cheesecakes 
        <br> 
        crack and we definitely want to prevent that. This is a 
        <br> 
        small step, but makes a big difference.
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <strong>Step 4: Bake the Cheesecake (without a water bath!)</strong>
        Pour batter into graham cracker crust, smooth the top and 
        <br> 
        bake. Bake at 325 degrees, reduce heat to 250 to finish 
        <br> 
        cooking. Keep the oven door closed this entire time!
        <br>
        <br>
        Let cheesecake sit in the hot oven with the oven closed for
        <br>  
        30 minutes before cracking the door and letting it continue 
        <br> 
        cooling for another hour. Remove from oven and bring 
        <br> 
        cheesecake to room temperature.
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <strong>Step 5: Refrigerate & Serve</strong>
        Once the cheesecake is at room temperature, you can 
        <br> 
        cover and refrigerate until completely chilled. The 
        <br> 
        beautiful thing about cheesecake is it’s a great dessert to 
        <br> 
        make in advance because it stores so well in the fridge.
    </ol>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        An ancient form of cheesecake may have been a popular dish in ancient 
        <br>
        Greece even prior to Romans' adoption of it with the conquest of Greece. 
        <br>
        The earliest attested mention of a cheesecake is by the Greek physician 
        <br>
        Aegimus (5th century BCE), who wrote a book on the art of making 
        <br>
        cheesecakes. The earliest extant cheesecake recipes are found in Cato 
        <br>
        the Elder's De Agri Cultura, which includes recipes for three cakes for 
        <br>
        religious uses: libum, savillum and placenta. Of the three, placenta 
        <br>
        cake is the most like modern cheesecakes: having a crust that is separately prepared and baked.
