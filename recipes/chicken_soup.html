    <h4>What is It?</h4>
     <p>
        Chicken soup is a soup made from chicken, simmered in water, usually with various other ingredients.
        <br> 
        The classic chicken soup consists of a clear chicken broth, often with pieces of chicken or vegetables; 
        <br>
        common additions are pasta, noodles, dumplings, or grains such as rice and barley.
        <br>
        Chicken soup has acquired the reputation of a folk remedy for colds and influenza, and in many countries is considered a comfort food.

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <p>Variations on the flavor are gained by adding root vegetables such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root; 
            <br>
            herbs such as parsley and dill; other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves, lettuce, or tomatoes; and black pepper.
            <br> 
            The soup should be brought slowly to a boil and then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. 
            <br>
            Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant.
