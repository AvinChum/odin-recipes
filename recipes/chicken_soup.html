    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h3>What is It?</h3>
     <p>
        Chicken soup is a soup made from chicken, simmered in water, usually with various other ingredients.
        <br> 
        The classic chicken soup consists of a clear chicken broth, often with pieces of chicken or vegetables; 
        <br>
        common additions are pasta, noodles, dumplings, or grains such as rice and barley.
        <br>
        Chicken soup has acquired the reputation of a folk remedy for colds and influenza, and in many countries is considered a comfort food.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h3>For the Broth:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1  chicken, 3 to 3 1/2 pounds, with skin, cut up</li>

            <li>1  parsnip or parsley root (optional)
                <br>
                About 1 dozen large sprigs parsley

            <li>2  bay leaves</li>

        </ul>

    <h3>To Finish The Soup</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>3  tablespoons reserved chicken fat, more if needed</li>
            <li>3  leeks, trimmed, halved lengthwise, rinsed and sliced crosswise into thin half-moons</li>
            <li>3  large carrots, peeled and cut into small dice</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and ground black or white pepper</li>
            <li>Egg noodles (fresh or dried), such
                <br>
                as packaged wide noodles,
                <br>
                spaetzle, fettuccine or pappardelle
                <br>
                cut into short lengths (see note)</li>
            <li>Finely chopped herbs, such as
                <br>
                parsley, scallions, dill or a
                <br>
                combination</li>
            
        </ul>

        
    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 1</strong>
                <br>
                Place the chicken, celery, carrots, onions, parsnip (if using), parsley, 
                <br>
                peppercorns, bay leaves and salt in a large soup pot and cover with cold water by 1 inch.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Step 2</strong>
                <br>
                Bring to a boil over high heat, then immediately reduce the heat to very low. 
                Adjust the heat until the soup is “smiling”: barely moving on the surface, with an 
                occasional bubble breaking through. Cook uncovered, until the chicken is very
                 tender and falling off the bone, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Step 3</strong>
                <br>
                When cool enough to handle, use tongs to transfer chicken from the pot to a 
                container. Taste the broth and continue to simmer it until it is concentrated and 
                tasty. Strain broth through a fine sieve (or a colander lined with cheesecloth) into 
                a separate container. Discard all the solids from the strainer (or reserve the 
                vegetables, chill and serve with vinaigrette, if you wish).
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Step 4</strong>
                <br>
                Refrigerate chicken pieces and broth separately for at least 8 hours (or up to 3 days), 
                until a thick layer of yellow fat has risen to the top of the broth.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Step 5</strong>
                <br>
                When ready to finish the soup, use your fingers to separate chicken breast meat from 
                bones and skin. Discard bones and skin. Use two forks to pull the breast meat apart into 
                soft chunks, or use a knife and cut into bite-size pieces. (Reserve dark meat for another use.)
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Step 6</strong>
                <br>
                Skim chicken fat from top of broth and set aside. Place 3 tablespoons of the fat in a soup 
                pot with a lid. Add leeks, stir to coat, and heat over medium heat until leeks begin to fry. 
                Then reduce the heat to a gentle sizzle and cook, stirring often, until slightly softened, 
                about 3 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Step 7</strong>
                <br>
                Add carrots, sprinkle with salt, stir, and cover the pot. Cook until vegetables are just 
                tender, about 5 minutes more. (Keep in mind that vegetables will continue to cook in the 
                soup.) Do not brown.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Step 8</strong>
                <br>
                Pour broth into pot with vegetables and heat to a simmer. Add noodles and simmer until 
                heated through, soft and plumped with chicken broth. Add the breast meat, then taste 
                broth and add salt and pepper to taste. For best flavor, soup should have some golden 
                droplets of fat on top; if needed, add more chicken fat one teaspoon at a time.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Step 9</strong>
                <br>
                Serve immediately, in a tureen or from the pot, sprinkling each serving with herbs.

            </li>

        </ol>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Variations on the flavor are gained by adding root vegetables such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root; 
            <br>
            herbs such as parsley and dill; other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves, lettuce, or tomatoes; and black pepper.
            <br> 
            The soup should be brought slowly to a boil and then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. 
            <br>
            Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant.
