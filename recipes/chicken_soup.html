            <li></li>
            
        </ul>


        <p>Variations on the flavor are gained by adding root vegetables such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root; 
            <br>
            herbs such as parsley and dill; other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves, lettuce, or tomatoes; and black pepper.
            <br> 
            The soup should be brought slowly to a boil and then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. 
            <br>
            Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant.
