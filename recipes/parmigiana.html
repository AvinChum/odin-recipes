    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>
        Chicken parmigiana, or chicken parmesan (Italian pollo alla parmigiana), 
        is a dish that consists of breaded chicken breast covered in tomato sauce 
        and mozzarella, parmesan, or provolone cheese. A quantity of ham or bacon is sometimes added.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Chicken Cutlets</strong>
            this is a thin piece of chicken that makes for more even cooking.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Flour:</strong>
            this is used for the dredging process and helps create a crispy exterior. If 
            you are looking for a gluten-free option use cornstarch
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Eggs + Milk:</strong>
            these two are mixed together and ensure that the parmesan sticks to the outside of the chicken.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Parmesan Cheese:</strong>
            freshly grated is best!
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Salt + Pepper:</strong>
            don’t forget to season.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Butter + Olive Oil:</strong>
            both are used for flavor but olive oil has a higher smoke point than butter.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Mozzarella Cheese:</strong>
            this is melted on top of the chicken and makes it taste so good!
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Marinara Sauce</strong>
            use homemade marinara sauce or use the store-bought kind (I like Rao’s Brand)!
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Linguine</strong>
            you could also use fettuccine noodles here.
        </li>
    </ul>
