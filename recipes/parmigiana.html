    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>
        Chicken parmigiana, or chicken parmesan (Italian pollo alla parmigiana), 
        is a dish that consists of breaded chicken breast covered in tomato sauce 
        and mozzarella, parmesan, or provolone cheese. A quantity of ham or bacon is sometimes added.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Chicken Cutlets</strong>
            this is a thin piece of chicken that makes for more even cooking.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Flour:</strong>
            this is used for the dredging process and helps create a crispy exterior. If 
            you are looking for a gluten-free option use cornstarch
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Eggs + Milk:</strong>
            these two are mixed together and ensure that the parmesan sticks to the outside of the chicken.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Parmesan Cheese:</strong>
            freshly grated is best!
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Salt + Pepper:</strong>
            don’t forget to season.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Butter + Olive Oil:</strong>
            both are used for flavor but olive oil has a higher smoke point than butter.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Mozzarella Cheese:</strong>
            this is melted on top of the chicken and makes it taste so good!
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Marinara Sauce</strong>
            use homemade marinara sauce or use the store-bought kind (I like Rao’s Brand)!
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Linguine</strong>
            you could also use fettuccine noodles here.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
            <strong> Step 1: Preheat Oven + Prep</strong>
            Preheat oven. Line a baking sheet with foil and top with
            <br> 
            roasting rack {or a cooling rack}. Set aside.
            <br>
            <br>
            Place flour, eggs and milk, and parmesan cheese into 3 
            <br>
            separate shallow bowls or plates for dredging. Add salt
            <br> 
            and pepper to the flour and egg and milk mixtures. Using
            <br> 
            a fork, beat the eggs and milk to combine.
            <br>
    </ol>

     <ol>
            <strong>Step 2: Preheat Pan + Dredge Chicken</strong>
            Preheat a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.
            <br> 
            Melt butter and olive oil in the pan as it heats. Dip 2 
            <br>
            chicken cutlets into the flour mixture, then egg mixture, 
            <br>
            then into the cheese to coat it evenly.
     </ol>

    <ol>
            <strong>Step 3: Cook Chicken + Top with Cheese</strong>
            Place into the hot pan and cook until each side is golden
            <br> 
            brown. Transfer to a cooling rack on a baking sheet and 
            <br>
            place into the oven to stay warm. Repeat with the 
            <br>
            remaining 2 chicken cutlets. Transfer those to the oven as 
            <br>
            well. Top each piece of chicken with a slice of fresh 
            <br>
            mozzarella and continue to warm.
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <strong> Step 4: Add Marinara Sauce + Assemble</strong>
            In hot pan that you cooked the chicken in, add the 
            <br>
            marinara sauce to warm through.
    </ol>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>The dish originated from 20th-century Italian diaspora. It has been 
        <br>
        speculated that the dish is based on a combination of the Italian melanzane 
        <br>
        alla Parmigiana, a dish using breaded eggplant slices instead of chicken, 
        <br>
        with a cotoletta, a breaded veal cutlet generally served without sauce or 
        <br>
        cheese in Italy.
        <br>
        Chicken parmigiana is included as the base of a number of different meals, 
        <br>
        including sandwiches and pies, and the meal is used as the subject of 
        <br>
        eating contests at some restaurants.</p>
